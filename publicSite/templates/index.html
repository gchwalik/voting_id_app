        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Our mission</strong> is to reduce the number of eligible voters turned away from the polls, due to lacking needed voting identification

        <p>
            <strong>Our goal</strong> is to connect those without access to identification with organizations and individuals that can provide transportation, information, and financial assistance.
