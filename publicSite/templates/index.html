        <h2>Letâ€™s turn the tide and give the vote back to the people.</h2>
        <h3>The problem:</h3>
        <p>
            Across the country, Voter ID laws are being passed that impose requirements that are both cost and time prohibitive for a significant portion of the electorate.
        </p>
        <h3>Our mission:</h3>
        <p>
            To simplify the sometimes prohibitive process of getting voter IDs nationwide, ensuring that all eligible voters can participate in making our democracy stronger.
        </p>
