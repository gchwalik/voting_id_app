        <h1>Our rights are under attack</h1>
        <p>
            Gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and partisanship have contributed to an unthinkable breach of voting rights in the modern era. The result of this movement, reinvigorated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, is that millions of voters have become disenfranchised. Most of those voters are marginalized people, who feel the impact of government policies most strongly.
